# Poster-rs üì¨
## MQTT5 client library

Poster-rs is an asynchronous, runtime agnostic, zero-copy MQTT 5 library,
designed having operation locality in mind.

## Features

- MQTTv5
- Runtime agnostic
- Zero-copy
- Per-subscription async streams
- No unsafe code

### Getting started

Firstly, choose your async runtime. Ready? Lets go!

In the below example we will use Tokio.

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use poster::{prelude::*, ConnectOpts, Context};
use tokio::net::TcpStream;
use tokio_util::compat::{TokioAsyncReadCompatExt, TokioAsyncWriteCompatExt};

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let (mut ctx, mut handle) = Context::new();

    let ctx_task = tokio::spawn(async move {
        // Set up a connection using your async framework of choice. We will need a read end, which is
        // AsyncRead, and write end, which is AsyncWrite, so we split the TcpStream
        // into ReadHalf and WriteHalf pair.
        let (rx, tx) = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:1883").await?.into_split();

        // Pass (ReadHalf, WriteHalf) pair into the context and connect with the broker on
        // the protocol level.
        ctx.set_up((rx.compat(), tx.compat_write())).connect(ConnectOpts::default()).await?;

        // Awaiting the Context::run invocation will block the current task.
        if let Err(err) = ctx.run().await {
            eprintln!("[context] Error occured: \"{}\", exiting...", err);
        } else {
            println!("[context] Context exited.");
        }

         Ok::<(), Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>(())
    });

    /* ... */

    ctx_task.await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

At this point, our [context](crate::Context) is up and running.

Let's break down the above example.
`poster-rs` is a runtime agnostic library, which means that all the asynchronous operations are abstracted
using traits from the `futures-rs` crate. The result of this approach is that connection with the broker
must be established manually and the library only cares about receving ([AsyncRead](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/trait.AsyncRead.html),
[AsyncWrite](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html)) pair during the context creation.
This pair is usually obtained using some sort of `split` functions on streams/sockets in the networking libraries.
(See [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.into_split), [smol](https://docs.rs/smol/latest/smol/io/fn.split.html))

new factory method gives us (Context, ContextHandle) tuple. Context is responsible
for handling the traffic between the client and the server. ContextHandle however, is a cloneable handle
to the Context actor and is used to perform all the MQTT operations.

Method run blocks the task (on .await) until one of the following conditions is met:
1. Graceful disconnection is performed (using ContextHandle::disconnect method).
   The result is then ().
2. Error occurs, resulting in MqttError. This may be the result of socket closing,
   receiving DISCONNECT from the server, etc.

### Publishing

Publishing is performed via the ContextHandle::publish method.

```rust
// ...
let opts = PublishOpts::default().topic("topic").data("hello there".as_bytes());
handle.publish(opts).await?;
```

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions are represented as async streams, obtained via the stream.
The general steps of subscribing are:
- await the invocation of ContextHandle::subscribe method
- validate the result (optionally)
- use stream method in order to create a stream for
the subscription.

Note that under the hood, the library uses subscription identifiers to group subscriptions.

```rust
// ...
let opts = SubscribeOpts::default().subscription("topic", SubscriptionOptions::default());
let rsp = handle.subscribe(opts).await?;
let mut subscription = rsp.stream();

while let Some(msg) = subscription.next().await {
    println!("topic: {}; payload: {}", msg.topic_name(), str::from_utf8(msg.payload()).unwrap());
}
```

User may subscribe to multiple topics in one subscription request.

```rust
// ...
let opts = SubscribeOpts::default()
    .subscription("topic1", SubscriptionOptions::default())
    .subscription("topic2", SubscriptionOptions::default());

let mut subscription = handle.subscribe(opts).await?.stream();

while let Some(msg) = subscription.next().await {
    println!("topic: {}; payload: {}", msg.topic_name(), str::from_utf8(msg.payload()).unwrap());
}
```

Each subscription may be customized using the SubscriptionOptions.

```rust
let opts = SubscribeOpts::default().subscription("topic", SubscriptionOptions {
    maximum_qos: QoS::AtLeastOnce,
    no_local: false,
    retain_as_published: true,
    retain_handling: RetainHandling::SendOnSubscribe,
});
```

SubscribeRsp struct represents the result of the subscription request. In order to access
per-topic reason codes, SubscribeRsp::payload method is used:

```rust
// ...
let rsp = handle.subscribe(opts).await?;
let all_ok = rsp.payload().iter().copied().all(|reason| reason == SubackReason::GranteedQoS2);
```

### Unsubscribing

Unsubscribing is performed by the ContextHandle::unsubscribe method.
Note that it does NOT close the subscription stream (it could lead to logic errors).

```rust
// ...
let opts = UnsubscribeOpts::default().topic("topic");
let rsp = handle.unsubscribe(opts).await?;
```

As with subscribing, per topic reason codes can be obtained by the UnsubscribeRsp::payload method.

### Keep alive and ping

If the ConnectOpts::keep_alive interval is set during the connection request,
the user must use the ContextHandle::ping method periodically.

### Disconnection

Disconnection may be initiated either by user or the broker. When initiated by the broker, the Context::run method
returns error::Disconnected error.

Graceful disconnection may be also performed by the user by using ContextHandle::disconnect method.
When disconnection is finished, Context::run method returns ().

```rust
// ...
handle.disconnect(DisconnectOpts::default()).await?;
```

### Error handling

The main library error type is error::MqttError enum found in error module.

### TSL/SSL

TSL/SSL libraries are available out there with AsyncRead, AsyncWrite TSL/SSL streams. These may be
supplied to the Context::set_up method. The library does not handle encription on its own.

## Dependencies

Poster-rs depends on the below crates:
